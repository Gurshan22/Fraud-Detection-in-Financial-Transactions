# Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions

This project would focus on developing models to identify fraudulent transactions in financial data. It would address the challenge of highly imbalanced datasets where fraudulent transactions are rare events.

Key Components:

Data preprocessing with feature scaling and encoding categorical variables
Feature engineering to create meaningful transaction patterns
Implementation of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Isolation Forest algorithms
Handling class imbalance using SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning
Performance metrics focused on minimizing false negatives
Ethical considerations regarding false positives and their impact on users
